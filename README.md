# OOBE_MX
A continuation of my old gamejam project... hopefully!

## Originally for the 2025 Inbound Shovel's itch.io game jam.

### An out of box experience waiting to be experienced! 

"Just set a few things up before starting the game! A lost media have been found, though the server have somehow survived over the years--the game client itself have been gone for a long time! That is, until just recently when the version 10 of the program was found somewhere. If you can't tell--It's inspired by Microsoft's lovely Windows 10 Operating System and the much more beloved metro UI. "

> kenzieshane.my.id for more dumb stuff!

Minimum requirements:
OS: Windows 7 or later, 512 MB of RAM, 1 GHz or more. 
If on android, it is recommended to 
use at least android 7 and above to play this game 
if you don't want to experience excruciating pain 
when trying to make the game to work on the built-in webview.
Apple devices have a limited amount of IndexedDB storage limit,
and their cache policy makes the save data of this game
(which relies on INDEXEDDB), incredibly suceptible to cache
clearing--removing your save data alongside other app caches.

Sorry if the game's low quality... apparently I have time management and hardware issues. My potato laptop is aging and no  huge upgrades have been done to it yet, so i have to endure developing this while the fps of my desktop cripples everytime the project become slightly chunky.
